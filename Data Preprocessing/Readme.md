\# Data Preprocessing Techniques

This project covers essential data preprocessing techniques such as
\*\*Data Cleaning\*\*, \*\*Normalization\*\*, and
\*\*Discretization\*\*. These steps are crucial for preparing data
before feeding it into machine learning models.

\## Features - Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and
noise. - Normalization: Scaling data to improve model performance. -
Discretization: Transforming continuous data into categorical bins.

\## Requirements - Python 3.x - Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and
Scikit-learn
