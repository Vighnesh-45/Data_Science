# Community Detection in Networks

This project demonstrates community detection in networks using Python. It focuses on identifying clusters or communities within a graph structure using popular algorithms and visualizing the results.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `community_detection.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading the graph, performing community detection, and visualizing the results.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and visualize graph datasets.
- Apply community detection algorithms such as:
  - Louvain Method
  - Girvan–Newman Algorithm
- Visualize detected communities using different colors.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `networkx`
- `matplotlib`
- `community` (python-louvain)
- `numpy`

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vighnesh-45/Data_Science.git
   cd community Detection
