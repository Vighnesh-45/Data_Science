# FP-Growth Algorithm (Frequent Pattern Tree)

This project implements the **FP-Growth Algorithm** for mining frequent itemsets. It's a highly efficient approach to association rule mining, especially when working with large datasets.

## 🧠 Objective

To discover frequently occurring patterns in transactional datasets without generating candidate itemsets, unlike the Apriori algorithm.

## 📁 Project Contents

- `FP_tree.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the FP-Growth algorithm.

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `collections`
- `matplotlib` (optional for visualizations)

## 🚀 Features

- Load and preprocess transactional data
- Construct the FP-Tree
- Mine frequent patterns
- (Optional) Visualize frequency distributions

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vighnesh-45/Data_Science.git
   cd FP Tree
