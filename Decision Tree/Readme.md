# Decision Tree Classifier

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python and popular machine learning libraries. It involves data preprocessing, training a classifier, and visualizing the results.

## 🧠 Objective

The goal is to classify data using a decision tree model and evaluate its performance using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

## 📁 Project Contents

- `decision_tree.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation of the Decision Tree model.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and preprocess dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier
- Visualize the decision tree
- Evaluate model performance

## 📦 Libraries Used
