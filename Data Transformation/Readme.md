\# Data Transformation Toolkit

This project provides essential techniques for transforming and
normalizing data to enhance machine learning model performance. The
primary focus areas include:

\## Features - \*\*Convert Furnishing Status to Numeric:\*\* Transform
categorical data into numerical values for improved model
compatibility. - \*\*Min-Max Normalization:\*\* Scale data within a
defined range (e.g., \[0, 1\]) to ensure consistent feature scaling. -
\*\*Z-Score Normalization:\*\* Standardize data by centering around zero
with a standard deviation of one.

\## Requirements - Python 3.x - Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and
Scikit-learn

\## Contributing Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this
project and submit a pull request.
