# Corporate Training and Course Network Visualizations

This repository contains interactive visualizations and experimental work related to corporate training and organizational course networks, built using the [vis-network](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/) JavaScript library, along with analysis in a Jupyter notebook.

## 📁 Contents

You can open these files directly in your browser (no server required).
